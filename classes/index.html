CURRICULUM: 
FreeState Gymnastics uses its own well established, proven curriculum which is developmental, age and gender appropriate. We have identified and incorporate the essential components of advanced gymnastic skills in a wide variety of lead up skills and activities on each piece of apparatus. Children of every age and ability are continually rehearsing the necessary shapes and sequences to safely and successfully advance to the next level of gymnastics. And all the while they are experiencing the joy of accomplishment in skillfully performing sequences of increasing complexity and difficulty appropriate to their age and ability. Since the vast majority of our students continue session after session our curriculum anticipates students continuing their gymnastic class all 36 weeks September to June. 

REGISTRATION: 
All classes have size limits to maintain our student/teacher ratio. Ratio is based on class level, students age, and facility capacity. All classes will be filled on a 1st paid basis and we will not hold space without payment. Some classes may be combined or canceled according to enrollment.

MAKE-UP POLICY: 
In order to protect the unique instructional quality of each class and the low student teacher ratio makeups are restricted. One make-up will be allowed per session when and only if the gym can accommodate. Prior approval for specific make-up day, class and time is required. 

SEVERE WEATHER: 
In the event of severe weather conditions (snow, ice, etc.), please call the gym (301-987-7060) and listen to the recording. Should we be forced to close due to the weather, we cannot guarantee class make-up opportunities or credit for missed classes. We do not follow Montgomery County Public School closings. 

CLASS OBSERVATION LIMITED: 
There is EXCELLENT observation available from the upstairs waiting room, no spectators in the gym. For reasons of safety and successful instruction, children must focus on their skills and their teacher. So that the students and their teachers attention is not divided between class and parents, parents are politely excluded from the gym floor. Insurance regulations really do restrict the gym to students and staff only. 

SUPERVISION 
Supervision is provided by FreeState only in the gym during class time and for enrolled class students. Parents are responsible to supervise their children in the office/ lobby/ restroom/ waiting areas/ parking lot before and after class or whenever the student has to leave the gym floor without their teacher. Instruction time begins with the warm-up so please arrive on time. Late arrivals who have missed significant lead up activities may be excluded from portions or entire remainder of that day's class.
